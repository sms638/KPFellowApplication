However, most technology is made with one type of user in mind: someone without disabilities. My long-term goal is to engineer technology solutions for social good with a focus on accessibility, usability, and equitability. Throughout high school, I conducted research at Drexel University&rsquo;s Human Computer Interaction Lab on the use of technology for children with autism. I worked closely with a professor and postdoc students to research and</span><span class="c6 c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/542633e4e4b0701411e83da5/t/5cd094b4eef1a12f4f90cfaa/1557173435279/2019_WISH_PARworkshop.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1603162258325000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3uMr02koL7GwBW5HfKaurz">&nbsp;jointly publish on the usability of </a></span><span class="c6 c0"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/542633e4e4b0701411e83da5/t/5cd094b4eef1a12f4f90cfaa/1557173435279/2019_WISH_PARworkshop.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1603162258325000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3uMr02koL7GwBW5HfKaurz">app</a></span><span class="c0 c6"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/542633e4e4b0701411e83da5/t/5cd094b4eef1a12f4f90cfaa/1557173435279/2019_WISH_PARworkshop.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1603162258326000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2w92quudsbZJ-Tj83jDxdg">s</a></span><span class="c5 c0">. The findings from the research highlighted a disparity: while technology can have positive effects on children&rsquo;s special education, there is a massive disconnect between those creating the technology, and the actual users. Technology can be used to mitigate developmental issues, but a myriad of users need to be taken into account to ensure applications are accessible. Currently I am enrolled in a UI/UX class to further study accessibility and equitable design in software engineering. My passion for user-friendly technology led me to intern at Thinker-Tinker, a start-up that creates tech toys to help children learn. Working on features for their upcoming mobile app in a fast-paced environment fueled my desire to become an entrepreneur and one day start my own company with social good in mind. The mentorship and community I would experience as a Kleiner Perkins fellow would provide me with the foundation to engineer innovative technologies that benefit a greater population.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">Describe your most meaningful experience(s) and why they matter to you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c0">In middle school, my first exposure to computer science was through a coding summer camp. I enjoyed the curriculum but attended begrudgingly after realizing I was the only girl in the entire 40 person camp. I felt very alone and thought perhaps computer science was too &ldquo;nerdy&rdquo;. This initial experience sparked my desire to see gender equality in technology. &nbsp;What if I could use my entrepreneurial spirit to create a change? Growing up, I vividly remember trying to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; my sister my latest lego creations and designing and printing new stickers to trade when sticker collecting was all the rage. But as I&rsquo;ve gotten older, I&rsquo;ve realized that I could harness these same entrepreneurial instincts to create something with a larger impact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned to securing a grant from NCWIT Aspire IT and finding a school to partner with in order to create a coding summer camp for girls. Every summer throughout high school, I worked with the Overbrook Educational Center (OEC), a title I Philadelphia school. I taught a free one-week coding camp for their middle school girls. OEC did not have a technology curriculum, so this camp was the students&rsquo; first exposure to computer science. Each year I organized women technology speakers, and designed and taught a new curriculum. I created lessons on Scratch, HTML, and virtual reality. &nbsp;Close bonds formed as the same students came back to attend the camp summer after summer. It was rewarding to know that I had successfully shared the allure of programming.</span></p></div></body></html>
